# MySqlCommand Cancellation

There are a number of APIs to cancel an executing `MySqlCommand`. The cancellation itself can take place in two ways:

* **Soft**. A "soft", or "logical", cancellation instructs the MySQL Server to stop executing the command. This is accomplished by sending a `KILL QUERY` command to the server. Because the MySQL protocol doesn't permit multiplexing of commands, the `KILL QUERY` command has to be sent on a different network connection to the same MySQL server. Using a proxy or a Layer 4 load balancer may interfere with the ability to send the `KILL QUERY` command to the same server and prevent cancellation from occurring. If the cancellation is successful, the underlying `MySqlConnection` remains usable.
* **Hard**. A "hard", or "physical", cancellation is implemented by closing the connection to the MySQL Server (usually by closing the TCP/IP socket). The intent is to return control to the MySQL client if a network partition has occurred or the server isn't responding. Because the underlying network connection has been closed, the `MySqlConnection` is no longer usable after this cancellation occurs.

The mechanisms for cancelling a command are:

**MySqlCommand.Cancel**. This attempts a soft cancellation for the specified command. If successful, the `ExecuteX(Async)` method will throw a `MySqlException` with `MySqlErrorCode.QueryInterrupted`.

**ExecuteXAsync(CancellationToken)**. If the `CancellationToken` passed to any `ExecuteXAsync` method is cancelled, a soft cancellation will be attempted for that command. If successful, the `ExecuteXAsync` method will throw an `OperationCanceledException`; its inner exception will be a `MySqlException` with `MySqlErrorCode.QueryInterrupted`.

**CommandTimeout**. Each `MySqlCommand` has a `CommandTimeout` property that specifies a timeout in seconds. (This is initialized from the [`DefaultCommandTimeout`](/connection-options/#DefaultCommandTimeout) setting in the connection string.) If this timeout is not `0`, then a soft cancellation will be attempted when the timeout expires. If successful, the `ExecuteX(Async)` method will throw a `MySqlException` with `MySqlErrorCode.CommandTimeoutExpired`; its inner exception will be a `MySqlException` with `MySqlErrorCode.QueryInterrupted`.

> **NOTE**
>
> `CommandTimeout` does not specify a timeout for the entire result set to be read.
> Instead, as per [the documentation for `SqlCommand.CommandTimeout`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.commandtimeout), it specifies "the cumulative time-out for all network packets that are read during the invocation of a method".
> That is, the timeout is reset at the beginning of each call to a public API method, e.g., `MySqlDataReader.Read` or `MySqlDataReader.NextResult`.
>
> For methods such as `MySqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery`, which perform all their work within a single public API method, then `CommandTimeout` does apply to the entirety of that operation.
> However, it still only controls the cumulative timeout for all network packets, not the total time taken to execute the command.
>
> To stop a MySQL operation after a specified amount of time, use an `ExecuteXAsync(CancellationToken)` overload and pass a `CancellationToken` that is cancelled after the desired timeout.

**CancellationTimeout**. The connection string can specify a [`CancellationTimeout`](/connection-options/#CancellationTimeout) timeout value. After `CommandTimeout` elapses (and a soft cancellation is started), the `CancellationTimeout` timer starts. If this times out, a hard cancellation is performed and the underlying network connection is closed. When this occurs, the `ExecuteX(Async)` method will throw a `MySqlException` with `MySqlErrorCode.CommandTimeoutExpired`.

### Notes

To distinguish a soft cancellation from `CommandTimeout` vs a hard cancellation from `CancellationTimeout`, check the inner exception of the `CommandTimeoutExpired` `MySqlException`: a soft cancellation will have a `QueryInterrupted` `MySqlException` as its `InnerException`.

To always perform a hard cancellation immediately when `CommandTimeout` expires, set `CancellationTimeout=-1` in the connection string. This was the default behavior of MySqlConnector prior to version 1.1.0.
